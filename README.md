# yt-to-mp3
A simple YouTube-to-mp3 downloader written for my dad to use in a single day. It's nothing special, but it's a working project I might as well showcase on my github page. It downloads a YouTube video given a link and tries to convert it in MP3. To do that, additional libraries are required to be on PATH (ffmpeg, I think. I found the answer on Stack Overflow). It's also my very first time using Tkinter.
